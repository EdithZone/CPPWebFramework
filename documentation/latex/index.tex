The C++ Web Framework (C\+WF) is an Open Source web framework, under M\+IT License, created by Herik Lima and Marcelo Eler, using C++ with Qt to be used in the development of web applications, having been heavily inspired by Java Servlets, Java\+Server Pages Standard Tag Library (J\+S\+TL), designed to consume few computational resources such as memory and processing and a low response time for requests. The C\+WF also adopts the M\+VC (Model-\/\+View-\/\+Controller) architecture, where you can create classes to take care of the business layer (Model), use C\+S\+TL (C++ Server Pages Standard Tag Library) within the Web Pages to take care of data presentation (View) and use the servlets as a between the two layers (Controller).

Because it is created in Qt, the C++ Web Framework can run on the same platforms supported by Qt\+: ~\newline


Desktop\+: Linux, OS X, Windows~\newline
 Embedded and R\+T\+OS\+: Linux, Q\+NX, Vx\+Works, Windows~\newline
 Mobile\+: Android, i\+OS, Windows~\newline


This web framework consists of a simplified set of classes, only one configuration file, called C\+P\+P\+Web.\+ini and a policy of using only C++ and Qt in the development of its components in order to avoid the installation of numerous libraries to avoid conflicts, maintain multiplatform characteristics, facilitate installation and keep the learning curve low in order to make web development as simple as possible, even for beginners.
